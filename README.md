# JS CheckBox
This task is from the challenge "30 projects in 30 days", in which I made `CheckBox` by vanilla JS. Using it you can manage your plans and improve your time management skills.


### Quickstart
You can see the working UI/UX of this task by the link: https://khanevich.github.io/CheckBox/

### Create a new project based on the CheckBox
Clone this repo into new project folder (e.g., CheckBox).
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/khanevich/CheckBox CheckBox
cd CheckBox
